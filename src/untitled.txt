Ideas:

1. Estimate where some geo_id is urban or rural by height_percentage -> Does not help
2. Esimate the soil condition of geo_id using land_surface_condition
3. Does discrepancy b/w ground floor type and other floor type tell us about something?? (interesting idea) -> does not help
4. If we try to tar encode all the categorical variables
5. 

Current Best approach:
1. Freq and tar encoding for geo features
2. Remove the raw id and geo id features
3. Then apply RF
